Sand Casino Sample Code Repository
This repository contains sample code from the Sand Casino website, a for-fun casino platform where players can engage in various games using their in-game items as currency. The website is built using modern full-stack technologies such as React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Firebase. The code in this repository is intended to demonstrate my full-stack development and showcases the structure and components I developed during the creation of the platform.
Please note that this repository contains only a small subset of the original codebase for demonstration purposes. The full code is proprietary and not available for public use.
